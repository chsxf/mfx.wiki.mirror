As its name suggests, the Core Manager is the most central component of MFX. It handles requests and responses by calling routes.

Most of its behavior is controlled by [configuration directives](Configuration-Directives#core-manager) and is described in the [[Lifecycle of a Request]] page.

However, the `CoreManager` class provides several useful methods that may help you control some requests or responses more adequately. Checkout the [API Reference](API-CoreManager) to learn more.
