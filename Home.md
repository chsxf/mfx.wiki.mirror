Welcome to the php-micro-framework wiki!

# What is php-micro-framework?

php-micro-framework (MFX in short) is a full-stack PHP framework originally designed to serve as a project basis for Cheese Burgames, a french independant video game studio. The first version has been introduced in 2013 and matured in 2016. With time, <abbr title="php-micro-framework in short">MFX</abbr> has evolved into a complete framework for external developments.

It can be used as the core of any regular website or API.
